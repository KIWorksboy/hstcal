HSTCAL 1.2 RELEASE NOTES

March 2013

The HSTCAL package provides an environment for compiling IRAF tasks
written in C without using IRAF at all.  The HSTIO image and 
tables C API has been replicated using CFITSIO. This API was 
used to compile the ACS calibration code CALACS and WFC3 calibration
code CALWF3 without IRAF. 

CALWF3
======
Version 3.0 of CALWF3 was installed in Nov 2012 as the calibration 
software that gets used in the archive and for pipeline calibrations, 
replacing the now outdated STSDAS/IRAF based version (both of which 
have been removed from STSDAS).  This release also includes calwf3
related tasks; namely, wf32d, wf3ccd, wf3ir, and wf3rej.

Changes since the last release of CALWF3 include:
* removed check for TDFTRANS for WFC3/IR data
* fixed a memory leak in calwf3
* fixed a CFITSIO bug in wf3rej
* WFC3/UVIS subarray bias correction step updated to correctly apply the proper reference data


CALACS
======
Version 8.1.2 of CALACS has been included in this release. Changes from previous release include:
* CALACS now uses CTE corrected dark and post-flash reference files as appropriate
* post-flash correction now enabled in calacs
* error values computed in acsrej have been corrected
