HSTCAL v1.1 Release Notes

July 2012

The HSTCAL package defines a CFITSIO-based replacement for IRAF's
image and table I/O C-API that can be used to compile IRAF tasks written
in C without actually using IRAF.

This package provides a version of the ACS calibration software, CALACS,
that get compiled without any dependence on IRAF.


Platform Support
================
This package has been compiled and tested on both Linux RedHat 32-bit and 64-bit environments, as well as Mac OS X 10.5(Leopard) and OS X 10.6(Snow Leopard).

HSTCAL
------
- Add a check for OpenMP and set up "use" flags for it if it's available. Add a configure-time argument, "--disable-openmp"
- Add a note as to why the CFITSIO tree is copied
- Add an option to use the system CFITSIO, rather than the local copy
- Updated to use CFITSIO version 3.28

imphttab (pkg/imphttab)
----------------------
- Modified the IMPHTTAB interpretation so that if a parameter is outside the range of the table data (which would require extrapolation instead of interpolation) a warning is printed and -9999.0 is returned.

CALACS (pkg/acs)
----------------
- CALACS v 8.0.5 now performs:
    = CTE correction, with and without parallel processing using OpenMP
        - http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/performance/calacs_cte/calacs_cte.html/
    = post-SM4 destriping
    = post-SM3 bias-shift correction
    = post-SM4 electronics cross-talk removal
    = These corrections only get applied to full-frame ACS/WFC exposures.
    = This version also performs ALL processing in units of electrons
        - All temporary files produced by CALACS have units of electrons

Bug fixes include:
- The I/O logic in CALACS was fixed so that CFITSIO no longer gets used to open files in read/write mode when a handle to that same image but different extension was already opened in readonly mode.
- This version optimized the CTE correction so that it will work best with SUBTHRESH=-10 and RN_CLIP=5.0 as passed in from the PCTETAB.
- CALACS updated so that when the photometry keywords are not calculated due to extrapolation the photcorr keyword is set to skipped in the output image. A message also shows up in the trailer file.
- CALACS now reports the ACS_CTE_NAME and ACS_CTE_VER variables to the primary header as the CTE_NAME and CTE_VER keywords after CTE processing. All CTE corrected products should now have these keywords.
- CALACS reports the full computation of the mean bias level in the _flt.fits header. The header value now reports the sum of the bias levels subtracted by each of the bias-level correction steps and prints out a trailer message reporting the values being subtracted by each step.
