HSTCAL Version 1.0 Release Notes

August 2011

This package provides for the first time ever a version of the
ACS calibration software, CALACS, compiled without any dependence on
IRAF. The HSTCAL package defines a CFITSIO-based replacement for IRAF's
image and table I/O C-API that can be used to compile IRAF tasks written
in C without actually using IRAF.  

Platform Support
================
This package has been compiled and tested on both Linux RedHat 32-bit and 64-bit environments, as well as Mac OS X 10.5(Leopard) and OS X 10.6(Snow Leopard).  

pkg/imphttab
=============
This library provides a common interface for reading and extracting 
photometry keyword values from the new IMPHTTAB photometry reference file.
The use of the IMPHTTAB reference table will replace calls to IRAF/STSDAS
synphot C functions for computing photometry keyword values during calibration.
This library gets linked into the new version of CALACS in the 'acs' package.
 

pkg/acs
========
CALACS Version 6.1.0 (16-May-2011) contains several updates to better
support post-SM4 data and to calibrate CR-SPLIT and NREPEAT > 1 CCD
data the same and to replace calls to synphot with use of a new photmetry reference file (IMPHTTAB). These changes include:

    - Replaces calls to IRAF/STSDAS synphot C functions (in
    acs2d/dophot.c) with use of the imphttab library to populate the
    photmetry keywords with values derived from the new photometry
    reference file IMPHTTAB.

    - All CCD data taken as either CR-SPLIT or REPEAT-OBS associations
    will be calibrated and combined as CR-SPLIT data. This will eliminate
    the generation of _sfl.fits files for ALL ACS CCD data in the pipeline
    and only produce _crj.fits files (along with the currently generated
    _flt.fits files for each input exposure). This change will NOT affect
    how ACS/SBC (MAMA) data gets processed, only ACS CCD observations.

    - The logic implemented in CALACS to correctly propogate the
    cosmic-ray DQ flags to the final FLT images was fixed.

    - The initialization of the ERR array values for ACS (post-SM4) did
    not match the expected ERR values given the inputs provided by the
    reference files. CALACS was refactored to perform BLEVCORR prior to
    doNoise, then changed to not use the bias value in initializing the
    ERR array values.
