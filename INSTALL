Experimentally (for now) this package is using waf for its build
system.  The Makefiles are vestigial and may be broken.

waf does not need to be installed.  A local copy is included in this
distribution.  It requires only Python 2.3 - 3.1 to run.

For more information about waf, type 

  > ./waf --help

A typical hstcal build would include the following:

  > ./waf configure --cfitsio=path_to_cfitsio --prefix=install_prefix
  > ./waf build
  > ./waf install

Notes about writing wscript files
=================================

Tracking dependencies
---------------------
C has two forms of #include syntax::

  #include "foo.h"

for local include files, and

  #include <foo.h>

for system include files.  waf will not track changes to system
include files, so the first syntax should be used whenever including
files within the project.

Outstanding waf issues
======================

waf dist seems to include all the .o files etc.
