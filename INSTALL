hstcal is using waf for its build system.

waf does not need to be installed.  A local copy is included in this
distribution, which requires only that Python 2.3 - 3.1 is installed.

waf can be used either in the traditional UNIX way:

  > ./configure --cfitsio=path_to_cfitsio
  > make

or by calling the waf script directly:

  > ./waf configure --cfitsio=path_to_cfitsio --prefix=install_prefix
  > ./waf build
  > ./waf install

For more information, run:

  > ./waf --help


Notes for developers
====================

Tracking dependencies
---------------------
C has two forms of #include syntax::

  #include "foo.h"

for local include files, and

  #include <foo.h>

for system include files.  waf will not track changes to system
include files, so the first syntax should be used whenever including
files within the project.
