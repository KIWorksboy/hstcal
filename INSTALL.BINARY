Installing HSTCAL binary distributions
--

hstcal binaries are distributed as a tar file containing a bin/
directory.  To install, find a place to extract the tar file
and enter the command

	tar xf hstcal-1.0.linux.tar.gz


To use the hstcal programs, you will want them to be on your search
path.

For csh:

	set path = ( $cwd/hstcal-1.0/bin $path )

For sh or bash:

	PATH=`pwd`/hstcal-1.0/bin:$PATH
	export PATH
